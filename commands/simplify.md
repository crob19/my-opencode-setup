---

Refactor @$ARGUMENTS to be simpler and more readable.

Goals:
- Reduce cognitive complexity
- Break down large functions into smaller, focused ones
- Remove unnecessary nesting
- Simplify conditional logic
- Use clearer variable and function names
- Add comments for non-obvious logic
- Follow language-specific best practices

For Python:
- Use list comprehensions where appropriate
- Leverage built-in functions
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines

For TypeScript:
- Use modern ES6+ features
- Leverage type system for clarity
- Follow functional programming patterns where appropriate

Maintain the same functionality while improving readability and maintainability.
